Project bootstraped with [Node Flowtype Boilerplate](https://github.com/jsynowiec/node-flowtype-boilerplate)

The aim of these Katas is to practice:
+ TDD
+ Pair programming
+ Refactoring
+ Simple design
+ Requirement changes
+ Coding standard

If you are thinking about Extreme Programming practices then :thumbsup:.

There are 3 sessions each with a very specific goal

+ implement rules
+ add changes
+ talk about solutions and share feedback

## Coding standard

+ Name everything (meaningful, searchable, explanatory)
+ No mutable state
+ 2 or fewer function arguments
+ Functions should not take any boolean argument
+ Functional over imperative (no for loops, no let)
+ Encapsulate conditinonals in functions
+ Code should be read from top to bottom with function callers and callee being close
