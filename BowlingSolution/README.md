## Rules

1. When scoring “X” indicates a strike, “/” indicates a spare, “-” indicates a miss

2. Each game, or “line” of bowling, includes ten turns, or “frames” for the bowler.

3. In each frame, the bowler gets up to two tries to knock down all the pins.

4. If in two tries, he fails to knock them all down, his score for that frame is the total number of pins knocked down in his two tries: for example "53" should score 8

5. If in two tries he knocks them all down, this is called a “spare” and his score for the frame is ten plus the number of pins knocked down on his next throw (in his next turn): for example "6/ 81" should score 18 (10 + 8) for the first frame and 9 (8 + 1) for the second frame for a total of 27 (18 + 9).

6. If on his first try in the frame he knocks down all the pins, this is called a “strike”. His turn is over, and his score for the frame is ten plus the simple total of the pins knocked down in his next 
 two rolls: for example "X 81" should score 18 (10 + 8) for the first frame and 9 (8 + 1) for the second frame for a total of 27 (18 + 9).

7. If he gets a spare or strike in the last (tenth) frame, the bowler gets to throw one or two more bonus balls, respectively. These bonus throws are taken as part of the same turn. If the bonus throws knock down all the pins, the process does not repeat: the bonus throws are only used to calculate the score of the final frame: for example 
    + "XXX" should score 30 (10 * 3)
    + "9/X" should score 20 (9 + 1 + 10)
    + "X6/" should score 20 (10 + 6 + 4)

8. The game score is the total of all frame scores: for example 
    + "X X X X X X X X X X X X" should score 300 (30 * 10)
    + "9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9- 9-" should score 90 (9 * 10)
    + "5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/ 5/5" should score 150 (15 * 10)
